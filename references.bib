	abstract = "This article presents a brief survey to visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems applied to multiple independently moving agents, such as a team of ground or aerial vehicles, a group of users holding augmented or virtual reality devices. Such visual SLAM system, name as collaborative visual SLAM, is different from a typical visual SLAM deployed on a single agent in that information is exchanged or shared among different agents to achieve better robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. We review the representative works on this topic proposed in the past ten years and describe the key components involved in designing such a system including collaborative pose estimation and mapping tasks, as well as the emerging topic of decentralized architecture. We believe this brief survey could be helpful to someone who are working on this topic or developing multi-agent applications, particularly micro-aerial vehicle swarm or collaborative augmented/virtual reality."
