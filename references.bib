	abstract = {The usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is increasing day by day. In recent years, UAVs are being used in increasing number of civil applications, such as policing, firefighting, etc in addition to military applications. Instead of using one large UAV, multiple UAVs are nowadays used for higher coverage area and accuracy. Therefore, networking models are required to allow two or more UAV nodes to communicate directly or via relay node(s). Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are formed which is basically an ad hoc network for UAVs. This is relatively a new technology in network family where requirements vary largely from traditional networking model, such as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks. In this paper, Flying Ad-Hoc Networks are surveyed along with its challenges compared to traditional ad hoc networks. The existing routing protocols for FANETs are then classified into six major categories which are critically analyzed and compared based on various performance criteria. Our comparative analysis will help network engineers in choosing appropriate routing protocols based on the specific scenario where the FANET will be deployed.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, technological progress in electronic and avionic systems, mainly device miniaturization and cost reduction, has boosted the performance of the UAV (Unmanned Ariel Vehicles). In addition to the military area, UAVs are nowadays very widespread in the field of civil application. Multiples UAVs system can cooperatively carry out missions more economically and efficiently compared to one UAV systems. Therefore, this choice lead to the development of new networking technologies between UAVs and ground control station. The UAVs network is known as FANET (Flying Ad-Hoc Network), and it is a subset of the MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network). There are many problems to be addressed before effective use of FANET can be made in order to provide reliable and stable context specific networks. In this paper, a view of FANETs is presented from the networking communication challenges perspective. The scope of this survey is to give a comprehensive overview about the existing communications architectures proposed for the FANET networks. We expose the routing protocols, mobility and trajectory optimization models that have been used in FANET to solve communication and collaboration issues between UAVs, we outline the security challenges that need to be overcome and discuss FANET networking open issues. Our goal is to provide a general idea to the researchers about the different topics to be addressed in this area.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a new routing protocol for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that equipped with directional antenna. We named this protocol Directional Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (DOLSR). This protocol is based on the well known protocol that is called Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR). We focused in our protocol on the multipoint relay (MPR) concept which is the most important feature of this protocol. We developed a heuristic that allows DOLSR protocol to minimize the number of the multipoint relays. With this new protocol the number of overhead packets will be reduced and the End-to-End delay of the network will also be minimized. We showed through simulation that our protocol outperformed Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol and Ad- Hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in reducing the End-to-End delay and enhancing the overall throughput. Our evaluation of the previous protocols was based on the OPNET network simulation tool.},

Due to the high-mobility of the nodes, these networks are very dynamic and the existing routing protocols partly fail to provide a reliable communication. We present Predictive-OLSR an extension to the Optimized Link-State Routing (OLSR) protocol: it enables efficient routing in very dynamic conditions. The key idea is to exploit GPS information to aid the routing protocol. Predictive-OLSR weights the expected transmission count (ETX) metric, taking into account the relative speed between the nodes. We provide numerical results obtained by a MAC-layer emulator that integrates a flight simulator to reproduce realistic flight conditions. These numerical results show that Predictive-OLSR significantly outperforms OLSR and BABEL, providing a reliable communication even in very dynamic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in military and civilian fields, which promotes the need of networking. Due to the complex features of UAV MANET, the development of UAV MANET faces many technical challenges, such as routing. Generally speaking, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol gives better performance on delay compare to AODV protocol, so the OLSR protocol meets the high demand for real-time of UAV communication. High mobility and load imbalanced are two significant characteristics of UAV networks. The performance of UAV networks is largely affected by these characteristics. In order to reduce the effects of these problems, a Mobility and Load aware OLSR (ML-OLSR) protocol is proposed in this paper. The mobility-aware algorithm and load-aware algorithm are introduced to the OLSR protocol. The modelling and simulation of the ML-OLSR protocol was completed within QualNet simulator. Simulation results show that ML-OLSR outperforms the original OLSR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and average end-to-end delay.},

The coordination module enhances their performance and efficiency. The multi agent systems can be employed for searching items in unknown environments. The searching of unexploded ordinance such as the land mines is an important application where multi agent systems can be best employed.

The overall objective is to enable simulation and evaluation of UAV swarms operating within articulated multi-layered technological ecosystems, such as the Urban Internet of Things (IoT). To this aim, FlyNetSim interfaces two open source tools, ArduPilot and ns-3, creating individual data paths between the devices operating in the system using a publish and subscribe-based middleware. The capabilities of FlyNetSim are illustrated through several case-study scenarios including UAVs interconnecting with a multi-technology communication infrastructure and intra-swarm ad-hoc communications.},

@techreport{AcharyaRBCCPS,
	abstract = {This paper describes CORNET, a co-simulation middleware for applications involving multi-robot systems like a network of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. Design of such systems requires knowledge of the flight dynamics of UAVs and the communication links connecting UAVs with each other or with the ground control station. Besides, UAV networks are dynamic and distinctive from other ad-hoc networks and require protocols that can adapt to high-mobility, dynamic topology and changing link quality in power constrained resource platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to co-design the UAV path planning algorithms and the communication protocols. The proposed co-simulation framework integrates existing tools to simulate flight dynamics and network related aspects. Gazebo with robot operating system (ROS) is used as a physical system UAV simulator and NS-3 is used as a network simulator, to jointly capture the cyber-physical system (CPS) aspects of the multi-UAV systems. A particular aspect we address is on synchronizing time and position across the two simulation environments, and we provide APIs to allow easy migration of the algorithms to real platforms.},

	abstract="SLAM is an abbreviation for simultaneous localization and mapping, which is a technique for estimating sensor motion and reconstructing structure in an unknown environment. Especially, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using cameras is referred to as visual SLAM (vSLAM) because it is based on visual information only. vSLAM can be used as a fundamental technology for various types of applications and has been discussed in the field of computer vision, augmented reality, and robotics in the literature. This paper aims to categorize and summarize recent vSLAM algorithms proposed in different research communities from both technical and historical points of views. Especially, we focus on vSLAM algorithms proposed mainly from 2010 to 2016 because major advance occurred in that period. The technical categories are summarized as follows: feature-based, direct, and RGB-D camera-based approaches.",
