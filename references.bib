	abstract = {Simulators play an important role in robotics research as tools for testing the efficiency, safety, and robustness of new algorithms. This is of particular importance in scenarios that require robots to closely interact with humans, e.g., in medical robotics, and in assistive environments. Despite the increasing number of commercial and open-source robotic simulation tools, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive up-to-date survey paper has reviewed and compared their features. This survey paper presents a comprehensive and detailed overview and a comparison between the most recent and popular commercial and open-source robotic software for simulation and interfacing with real robots. A case-study is presented, showing the versatility in porting the control code from a simulation to a real robot. Finally, a detailed step-by-step documentation on software installation and usage has been made available publicly on the Internet, together with downloadable code examples. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

Due to the high-mobility of the nodes, these networks are very dynamic and the existing routing protocols partly fail to provide a reliable communication. We present Predictive-OLSR an extension to the Optimized Link-State Routing (OLSR) protocol: it enables efficient routing in very dynamic conditions. The key idea is to exploit GPS information to aid the routing protocol. Predictive-OLSR weights the expected transmission count (ETX) metric, taking into account the relative speed between the nodes. We provide numerical results obtained by a MAC-layer emulator that integrates a flight simulator to reproduce realistic flight conditions. These numerical results show that Predictive-OLSR significantly outperforms OLSR and BABEL, providing a reliable communication even in very dynamic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in military and civilian fields, which promotes the need of networking. Due to the complex features of UAV MANET, the development of UAV MANET faces many technical challenges, such as routing. Generally speaking, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol gives better performance on delay compare to AODV protocol, so the OLSR protocol meets the high demand for real-time of UAV communication. High mobility and load imbalanced are two significant characteristics of UAV networks. The performance of UAV networks is largely affected by these characteristics. In order to reduce the effects of these problems, a Mobility and Load aware OLSR (ML-OLSR) protocol is proposed in this paper. The mobility-aware algorithm and load-aware algorithm are introduced to the OLSR protocol. The modelling and simulation of the ML-OLSR protocol was completed within QualNet simulator. Simulation results show that ML-OLSR outperforms the original OLSR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and average end-to-end delay.},

	abstract = {This paper describes CORNET, a co-simulation middleware for applications involving multi-robot systems like a network of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. Design of such systems requires knowledge of the flight dynamics of UAVs and the communication links connecting UAVs with each other or with the ground control station. Besides, UAV networks are dynamic and distinctive from other ad-hoc networks and require protocols that can adapt to high-mobility, dynamic topology and changing link quality in power constrained resource platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to co-design the UAV path planning algorithms and the communication protocols. The proposed co-simulation framework integrates existing tools to simulate flight dynamics and network related aspects. Gazebo with robot operating system (ROS) is used as a physical system UAV simulator and NS-3 is used as a network simulator, to jointly capture the cyber-physical system (CPS) aspects of the multi-UAV systems. A particular aspect we address is on synchronizing time and position across the two simulation environments, and we provide APIs to allow easy migration of the algorithms to real platforms.},

We developed a heuristic that allows DOLSR protocol to minimize the number of the multipoint relays. With this new protocol the number of overhead packets will be reduced and the End-to-End delay of the network will also be minimized. We showed through simulation that our protocol outperformed Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol and Ad- Hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in reducing the End-to-End delay and enhancing the overall throughput.

In this paper, we focus on the non-optimal coverage problem of free dynamic area coverage algorithms. We propose a distributed dynamic area coverage algorithm based on reinforcement learning and a {\$}\backslashgamma {\$} -information map. The {\$}\backslashgamma {\$} -information map can transform the continuous dynamic coverage process into a discrete {\$}\backslashgamma {\$} point traversal process, while ensuring no-hole coverage. When agent communication covers the whole target area, agents can obtain the global optimal coverage strategy by learning the whole dynamic coverage process. In the event that communication does not cover the whole target area, agents can obtain a local optimal coverage strategy; in addition, agents can use the proposed algorithm to obtain a global optimal coverage path through off-line planning. Simulation results demonstrate that the required time for area coverage with the proposed algorithm is close to the optimal value, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the distributed anti-flocking Algorithms for dynamic area coverage.},

In essence, SfM involves the three main stages of (i) extracting features in images (e.g. points of interest, lines, etc.) and matching these features between images, (ii) camera motion estimation (e.g. using relative pairwise camera positions estimated from the extracted features), and (iii) recovery of the 3D structure using the estimated motion and features (e.g. by minimizing the so-called reprojection error). This survey mainly focuses on relatively recent developments in the literature pertaining to stages (ii) and (iii). More specifically, after touching upon the early factorization-based techniques for motion and structure estimation, we provide a detailed account of some of the recent camera location estimation methods in the literature, followed by discussion of notable techniques for 3D structure recovery. We also cover the basics of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, which can be viewed as a specific case of the SfM problem. Further, our survey includes a review of the fundamentals of feature extraction and matching (i.e. stage (i) above), various recent methods for handling ambiguities in 3D scenes, SfM techniques involving relatively uncommon camera models and image features, and popular sources of data and SfM software.},

	abstract = {Mobile sensor networks (MSNs) are often used for monitoring large areas of interest (AoI) in remote and hostile environments, which can be highly dynamic in nature. Due to the infrastructure cost, MSNs usually consist of a limited number of sensor nodes. In order to cover large AoI, the mobile nodes have to move in an environment while monitoring the area dynamically. MSNs that are controlled by most of the previously proposed dynamic coverage algorithms either lack adaptability to dynamic environments or display poor coverage performances due to considerable overlapping of sensing coverage. As a new class of emergent motion control algorithms for MSNs, antiflocking control algorithms enable MSNs to self-organize in an environment and provide impressive dynamic coverage performances. The antiflocking algorithms are inspired by the solitary behavior of some animals who try to separate from their species in most of daily activities in order to maximize their own gains. In this paper, we propose two distributed antiflocking algorithms for dynamic coverage of MSNs, one for obstacle-free environments and the other for obstacle-dense environments. Both are based on the sensing history and local interactions among sensor nodes.},

In recent years, UAVs are being used in increasing number of civil applications, such as policing, firefighting, etc in addition to military applications. Instead of using one large UAV, multiple UAVs are nowadays used for higher coverage area and accuracy. Therefore, networking models are required to allow two or more UAV nodes to communicate directly or via relay node(s). Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are formed which is basically an ad hoc network for UAVs. This is relatively a new technology in network family where requirements vary largely from traditional networking model, such as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks. In this paper, Flying Ad-Hoc Networks are surveyed along with its challenges compared to traditional ad hoc networks. The existing routing protocols for FANETs are then classified into six major categories which are critically analyzed and compared based on various performance criteria. Our comparative analysis will help network engineers in choosing appropriate routing protocols based on the specific scenario where the FANET will be deployed.},

	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in researching, developing and deploying multi-robot systems. This has been driven mainly by: the maturity of the practical deployment of a single-robot system and its ability to solve some of the most challenging tasks. Coverage path planning (CPP) is one of the active research topics that could benefit greatly from multi-robot systems. In this paper, we surveyed the research topics related to multi-robot CPP for the purpose of mapping and model reconstructions. We classified the topics into: viewpoints generation approaches; coverage planning strategies; coordination and decision-making processes; communication mechanism and mapping approaches. This paper provides a detailed analysis and comparison of the recent research work in this area, and concludes with a critical analysis of the field, and future research perspectives.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to solve the online complete coverage task of autonomous cleaning robots in unknown workspaces based on the boustrophedon motions and the Asearch algorithm (BA). In this approach, the robot performs a single boustrophedon motion to cover an unvisited region until it reaches a critical point. To continue covering the next unvisited region, the robot wisely detects backtracking points based on its accumulated knowledge, determines the best backtracking point as the starting point of the next boustrophedon motion, and applies an intelligent backtracking mechanism based on the proposed Asearch with smoothed path on tiling so as to reach the starting point with the shortest collision-free path. The robot achieves complete coverage when no backtracking point is detected. Computer simulations and experiments in real workspaces prove that our proposed BAis efficient for the complete coverage task of cleaning robots. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the task of determining a path that passes over all points of an area or volume of interest while avoiding obstacles. This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Arkin2000,
	abstract = {We study the problem of finding shortest tours/paths for “lawn mowing” and “milling” problems: Given a region in the plane, and given the shape of a “cutter” (typically, a circle or a square), find a shortest tour/path for the cutter such that every point within the region is covered by the cutter at some position along the tour/path. In the milling version of the problem, the cutter is constrained to stay within the region. The milling problem arises naturally in the area of automatic tool path generation for NC pocket machining. The lawn mowing problem arises in optical inspection, spray painting, and optimal search planning. Both problems are NP-hard in general. We give efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for both problems. In particular, we give a (3+$\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm for the lawn mowing problem and a 2.5-approximation algorithm for the milling problem. Furthermore, we give a simple View the MathML source-approximation algorithm for the TSP problem in simple grid graphs, which leads to an View the MathML source-approximation algorithm for milling simple rectilinear polygons.},

The following paper provides comparison based analysis of various network simulators. Simulators taken into consideration are Ns-2, Ns-3, OMNeT++, NetSim, REAL, OPNET and QualNet. Information about simulators such as features, advantages, disadvantages, backend environment, the supporting operating system, and minimum hardware requirement is discussed in the following paper. So based on above-mentioned information and analysis, one can make choice of an appropriate network simulator based on the requirements.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, technological progress in electronic and avionic systems, mainly device miniaturization and cost reduction, has boosted the performance of the UAV (Unmanned Ariel Vehicles). In addition to the military area, UAVs are nowadays very widespread in the field of civil application. Multiples UAVs system can cooperatively carry out missions more economically and efficiently compared to one UAV systems. Therefore, this choice lead to the development of new networking technologies between UAVs and ground control station. The UAVs network is known as FANET (Flying Ad-Hoc Network), and it is a subset of the MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network). There are many problems to be addressed before effective use of FANET can be made in order to provide reliable and stable context specific networks. In this paper, a view of FANETs is presented from the networking communication challenges perspective. The scope of this survey is to give a comprehensive overview about the existing communications architectures proposed for the FANET networks. We expose the routing protocols, mobility and trajectory optimization models that have been used in FANET to solve communication and collaboration issues between UAVs, we outline the security challenges that need to be overcome and discuss FANET networking open issues. Our goal is to provide a general idea to the researchers about the different topics to be addressed in this area.},

MANETs are found very useful in real applications such as time-lacking implementations and indoor environments. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Network (BATMAN) routing protocols, in stairs environment, based on real data from our MANET testbed. We evaluate the performance considering three metrics: throughput, delay and packet loss. We design and implement two experimental scenarios: static stairs scenario and shifting stairs scenario. From our experiments, we show that as the number of hops increases to three or more hops, the performance of the communication decreases. The performance decreases further when the nodes are mobile. However, OLSR shows a better performance than BATMAN. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Focusing either on the modeling of UAV operations or communication and network dynamics, available simulation tools fail to capture the complex interdependencies between these two aspects of the problem. The main contribution of this paper is a flexible and scalable open source simulator – FlyNetSim – bridging the two domains. The overall objective is to enable simulation and evaluation of UAV swarms operating within articulated multi-layered technological ecosystems, such as the Urban Internet of Things (IoT). To this aim, FlyNetSim interfaces two open source tools, ArduPilot and ns-3, creating individual data paths between the devices operating in the system using a publish and subscribe-based middleware. The capabilities of FlyNetSim are illustrated through several case-study scenarios including UAVs interconnecting with a multi-technology communication infrastructure and intra-swarm ad-hoc communications.},
